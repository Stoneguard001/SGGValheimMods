# My Favorite Valheim
This mod gives you the ability to save servers to a favorites list and keep the information on your last Join IP.

## Features

- You can save a server to a favorites list for each character.
- It will save your last Join IP information (address/url and password) for each character.

## Known isssues

- UI placement : The current placement of controls on the UI is not optimized for all screen resolutions.
- Server status: The status of the servers in favorites are currently unknown. This will be resolved as the code that loads servers is optimized.

## Planned enhancements

- Remove Favorite : I am planning to add a Remove Favorite button in the next release. 
- Options flags : I am planning to add a flag for saving Join IP passwords.
