# My Favorite Valheim
This mod gives you the ability to save servers to a favorites list and keep the information on your last Join IP.

## Latest changes

# Current Version 0.5.0
- Much better alignment of UI Elements.
- Add Join IPs to list of Favorites.
- Add 'Save to favorites' on Join IP box.
- Connect to Direct IPs from Favorites list.

## Features

- You can save a server to a favorites list for each character.
- Join IPs are now added to the favorites list.
- You can now add multiple Join IPs to the favorites list.

## Use

Once installed, you will need to use the manual refresh button (to the left of the filter field) to get a list of servers. 
Once you select a server, you can choose 'Save to favorites' to add it to your own list of favorites for the current Character.
When directly joining an IP, you can also select 'Save to favorites' on the pop-up box to save that IP to the favorites list.
Each character has their own Favorites list. 
To see a character's Favorites, click the Favorites tab. It uses the Join Server page to list favorites.
You can remove a favorite from the list by selecting it and pressing the 'Remove favorite' button.

## Known isssues

- Manual server list : To get the list of active servers, you will need to manually press the refresh button on the server list page.
- Server status : The status of the servers in favorites are currently unknown. This will be resolved as the code that loads servers is optimized.

## Planned enhancements

- Options flags : I am planning to add a flag for saving Join IP passwords.
